## Game Instructions

Start the game by clicking on 'Play' button,

or view 'credits'.
Move your player using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
When in battle, use arrow keys to choose and space bar or left arrow to confirm your characters attack and
try to defeat the enemies.

## Game Design

This is a turn-based role-playing game(RPG). I got the idea from the game I used to play called ADOM.
In the game there are two main characters: A warrior and A mage, they travel the world and fight dragons.
To navigate in the world scene, the player uses keyboard arrows up, down, left, right.
In the battle scene, use keyboard arrows up, down, left, and space bar to attack the chosen enemy. Inside the battle, the scene player can see his characters' and enemies' health bars at all times.
Also there are player's score available to see in the top bar in both of the scenes, when player want to quit, he can use the button 'Exit' in the top right of the bar, after clicking said button player is taken to High Score scene, where all top players and their scores are listed.
